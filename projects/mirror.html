    <div class="description">
      Discriminating mirror is a mirror that only works for its creators. It uses tensorflow running on a raspberry pi to detect its users' similarity to its creators, and increasingly glitches their image dependent on how much the user looks like the people who made it. Made with Adi Dahiya for the 2019 ITP Spring Show.
