      Stay in Bed Simulator is a game controlled by a bed. The player's movements in the (physical) bed control their movements in the game. There is no win condition. There is a TV to watch and a phone to look at. You lose the game if you get out of bed in the game, or in real life.
      This was mostly made as a response to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/dont-play-the-goose-game/600472/">Ian Bogost's writing about games</a> and the idea of "playbor". If games are work, what does a game that discourages work look like?
