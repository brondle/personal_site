          <p> Hi! I'm Brent. I'm a programmer, researcher, and artist currently finishing my master's at <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp" target="_blank">ITP</a>. I don't update this site very often, but you can keep up with what I'm doing there on my <a href="https://medium.com/@brentbailey">Medium</a>.
            <br />

            <br />
            I'm interested in why computers and computer programs work the way they do, models (algorithmic and otherwise), and games. I also like teaching and writing about my interests. <br />
            <br />
            In past lives I studied analytic philosophy and worked as a front-end developer and a winemaker and salesman. <br />

            <br />
            My website still uses jQuery because I am a sentimental man.</p>
